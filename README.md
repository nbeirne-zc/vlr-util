# vlr-util
Some general, modular, C++ utility code

This project is some utility code which I have written, intended to augment other utility code in the C++ ecosystem. No particular organization is expressed or implied; this is an attempt to make something which can be used as a reusable starting point for me, when doing C++ projects. In addition, it is a test bed for trying things which I don't often have enough time to investigate while "on the clock" (eg: unit tests, CI/CD, markdown, open source, etc.).

If it gets big enough, I'll think about organization more.
